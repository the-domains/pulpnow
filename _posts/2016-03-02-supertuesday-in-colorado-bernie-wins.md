On Tuesday night, Senator Bernie Sanders handily beat out Secretary Hillary Clinton in Colorado. Sanders won by 18% of the vote, soundly winning 58% to Clinton's 40%. 

But looking at his win, for Colorado's 79 delegates, Sanders won nearly all the counties west of I-25\. And Clinton won her share east of I-25\.
