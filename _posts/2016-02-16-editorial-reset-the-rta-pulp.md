description: "Pueblo's RTA bid was always an odd duck. The \"Heritage of Heroes\" seemed little more than jumbled pieces on the Riverwalk - a Professional Bull Riders University, an aquatic park, the expansion of the Pueblo Convention Center and piecemeal odes to veterans. Now it's stalled because the state wants a strong commitment from the bull riders."
