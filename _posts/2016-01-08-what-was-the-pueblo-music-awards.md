description: "In January's edition of PULP we feature the 1960s Pueblo's pop and the Teardrops by Lisa Wheeler. While Lisa was working on this story she came across this poster of the Pueblo Music Awards. You can see the Teardrops right of the titling on the poster. It was a short lived local award show produced by Frank Ortega, in the late 90s."
