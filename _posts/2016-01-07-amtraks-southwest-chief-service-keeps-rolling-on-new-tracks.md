description: "GARDEN CITY, Kan.- Amtrak's Southwest Chief train is rumbling through the pre-dawn darkness just east of the Colorado border when a pickup truck pulls into view on U.S. Highway 50, which parallels the tracks. The truck slowly catches up to the train and then passes us, its taillights disappearing toward the Rockies."
