(AP) - From where Peggy Sheahan stands, deep in rural Colorado, the last eight years were abysmal. Otero County, where Sheahan lives, is steadily losing population.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Editorial: Reset the RTA? - PULP</h1><p>Pueblo's RTA bid was always an odd duck. The "Heritage of Heroes" seemed little more than jumbled pieces on the Riverwalk - a Professional Bull Riders University, an aquatic park, the expansion of the Pueblo Convention Center and piecemeal odes to veterans. Now it's stalled because the state wants a strong commitment from the bull riders.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ad23dd3e8776aabcfb23f06cda5d2cec602fd547.jpg"></article>]]></description>
