            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This student's sexist Yik Yak comment about #blackwomenmatter just got him suspended</h1><p>When Thaddeus Pryor saw a Yik Yak message that said "#blackwomenmatter," he responded: "They matter, they're just not hot," according to the Colorado Springs Gazette.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The economic promise of Pueblo chile - PULP</h1><p>Is that chile you're eating really a Pueblo chile? Pueblo County Economic Development Director Chris Markuson wants locals, and eventually consumers across the country, to ask that question as the Pueblo chile grows in popularity. The question will hopefully be the result to a three-year strategic plan to build the brand around the Pueblo chile.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d74103d3e88493b0fab4ab1619b0dd15aad6e0d0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The Upshot came to this conclusion by looking at six data points for each county in the United States: education (percentage of residents with at least a bachelor's degree), median household income, unemployment rate, disability rate, life expectancy and obesity.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d931f5601ca47f5201d7105aebd7a76d398080dc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
